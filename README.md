## A simple introduction to Docker for novices

These files support a short workshop by @alecthegeek to introduce junior developers
and other novices to Docker concepts and basic commands. Refer to the 
associated [workbook](https://github.com/dockerfornovices/DockerSimpleDemo/wiki/WorkBook) for more information.

Some familiarity with Linux and the command line is assumed, but no
previous knowledge of Docker is required.



This material is too short to teach you everything you need.
I recommend taking a look at @BretFisher's Udemy course 
[Docker Mastery](http://dockermastery.com/) if you want to get up to speed.
Note this is not a paid referral, I'm just a happy student.
